# ud036_StarterCode
Source code for a Movie Trailer website.

## Instructions
Run entertainment_center.py or open fresh_tomatoes.html

## Notes
entrtainment_center.py defines six instances of Movie class found in media.py and initiates them with a movie title, storyline, poster image url, and youtube movie trailer url. Then entertainment_center.py creates an array called movies with the 6 Movie instance names and passes it as an argument to a function called open_movies_page in fresh_tomatoes.py. 

fresh_tomatoes.py creates fresh_tomatoes.html to show the six movies poster image, title, and when clicked plays the youtube movie trailer.
